# Productized Service Best Practices Report

Based on uploaded course lessons, brainstorms, and business plan notes.

## 1. Define Your Niche & Target Market
- Primary niche: therapists and healthcare startups
  - User-friendly websites that improve engagement and scheduling
- Expansion niches (later): dentists, chiropractors, nonprofits, real estate, barbershops
- Pain points: ease of use, reliability, compliance, affordability
- Action: interview practitioners to validate assumptions

## 2. Create a Productized Offering
- Core package: Therapist Website Starter
  - 5 pages (Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact)
  - Mobile responsive, basic SEO, contact form, analytics, social links
  - One revision round (upsell additional rounds)
- One-active-request workflow with 48â€“72 hour turnarounds

## 3. Build Your Systems
- Trello (5 columns): Client Hub -> Content Requests -> Active -> Client Review -> Done
- Onboarding: payment -> intake form -> Trello auto-board -> kickoff call
- Reusable page templates for speed and consistency

## 4. Marketing & Client Acquisition
- Build a mock portfolio and before/after case studies
- Collect testimonials early (even from discounted or free builds)
- Referral program for existing clients

## 5. Upsells & Add-ons
- Maintenance plan, extra pages, branding/logo, scheduling, e-commerce

## 6. Pricing Strategy
- Maintain 50-70% margins; keep outsourcing <= 30-50% of package price
- Start lower to build momentum; raise as social proof grows

## 7. Efficiency & Scaling
- Prefer async updates over meetings
- Automate onboarding, tasks, and payments
- Create SOPs; expand to new niches after proving the first
